# CanteenApp

Built a Responsive Web application to enable remote ordering at my College Canteen. This project was done in order to improve my skills in FrontEnd Development.
The FrontEnd was done using **HTML**,**CSS**,**Bootstrap** and **JQuery**. All the responsiveness and interactive components you can see on the website has been coded by me from scratch (mostly), without using third party libraries as a personal challenge and learning exercise.

I have also used **Regular Expressions**, with patterns created on my own, to verify login credentials.

I used **Flask** on the backend, with **MongoDB** hosted on [Mlab](https://mlab.com/home) as the Database.

## Login
You can try using this to login, or else create your own login details. The SAP ID follows a certain RegExp pattern hence, would be easier to use the details provided below.

**SAP ID**: 70002014015

**Password**: 1234Demo
